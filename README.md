What is TatsuBot (or u/Not_a_brat_Tatsumaki)?

TatsuBot is a basic Reddit comment responder based on the character "Tatsumaki" from the TV show "One Punch Man." 

TatsuBot was made as a precursor to MemeTuesdayBot. It's primary function is to allow me to get used PRAW, but I will continue to make updates if there are features to be added.
